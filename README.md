# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## Project Overview
This project implements a Linear Regression model to predict house prices based on basic housing features.
It is a beginner-level machine learning project focused on understanding the complete supervised learning workflow.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about houses such as:

- MSSubClass
- LotArea
- OverallCond
- YearBuilt
- YearRemodAdd
- TotalBsmtSF
- SalePrice (Target variable)

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded the dataset using Pandas
2. Performed basic data cleaning
3. Converted categorical features using encoding
4. Selected features (X) and target variable (y)
5. Split data into training and testing sets
6. Trained a Linear Regression model
7. Evaluated the model using:
   - R² Score
   - MAE
   - RMSE

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Output
The model predicts house prices and is evaluated using standard regression metrics.
